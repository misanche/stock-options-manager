## Learnings

### Telegram Settings UI (2026-03-29)
- Added Telegram configuration endpoints to `web/app.py`:
  - `GET /settings` — Returns current config with token masked
  - `POST /settings` — Persists Telegram settings to config.yaml, reloads notifier
  - `POST /api/settings/test-telegram` — Sends test message to configured channel
- Updated `web/templates/settings.html` with Telegram card:
  - Enable/disable checkbox, bot token input (type="password"), channel ID input
  - Test button, Save/Cancel buttons, status message area
  - JavaScript handlers for form interaction and API calls with inline feedback
- Commit: 4e1c16c (merged with Danny's work).

### Manual Roll Button + Signal Display Fix (symbol_detail)
- Added "Roll" button to positions table actions column (active positions only), next to Close.
- Roll form is an inline expandable panel inside the `pos-detail-row`, hidden by default. Contains: new strike (pre-filled), new expiration (pre-filled), optional notes, confirm/cancel buttons, and a message area.
- JS: Roll button click expands the detail row and reveals the form. Confirm POSTs to `/api/symbols/{sym}/positions/{id}/roll` with `{new_strike, new_expiration, notes}`. Cancel hides the form.
- Updated row click handler exclusion to also ignore `[data-roll-pos]` and `.roll-form` clicks.
- Signal table now shows roll context: if `new_strike`/`current_strike` are present, strike column shows "(from $X)"; same pattern for expiration. Enables users to see what the monitor agent recommended rolling to/from.

### Roll Position Frontend (decision_detail + symbol_detail)
- `decision_detail.html`: Signal banner button is now conditional on `decision.agent_type`. Watch agents (`covered_call`, `cash_secured_put`) → "Open Position" button (existing `/from-decision/` endpoint). Monitor agents (`open_call_monitor`, `open_put_monitor`) → "Roll Position" button (new `/roll-from-decision/` endpoint). JS refactored with shared `showMsg()` helper, each button handler is guarded by `getElementById` null-check so only the rendered button gets wired up. Renamed `openPosMsg` → `actionMsg`.
- `symbol_detail.html`: Expandable position detail panel now shows two additional sections after the source/manual block: (1) "📉 Closed by signal" section using `pos.closing_source` with same detail-grid layout as opening source, orange border-left for closing reason; (2) Roll reference links using `pos.rolled_from` / `pos.rolled_to` in a subtle flex row. Both sections are conditional and gracefully absent when the data isn't present.
- Roll endpoint depends on Rusty's backend work (`POST /api/symbols/{sym}/positions/roll-from-decision/{id}`).

### Open Position from Decision + Expandable Positions (frontend)
- `decision_detail.html`: "Open Position" button conditionally rendered when `is_signal` is true; POSTs to `/api/symbols/{sym}/positions/from-decision/{id}`, shows success/error inline, redirects to symbol page after 1s. Confirmation dialog warns about watchlist disable.
- `symbol_detail.html`: Positions table now expandable — each row has a ▸/▾ chevron toggling a detail `<tr>` with `colspan="8"`. Detail panel shows `pos.source` signal data (strategy, decision, confidence, underlying price, premium, IV, risk flags, reason) using existing `detail-grid` CSS class, or "Created manually" for positions without source.
- Event propagation: Close/Delete button clicks use `e.target.closest()` guard to prevent row expand/collapse from firing on button clicks.
- Colspan is 8 (added chevron column to positions table header).
- Agent type formatting: `covered_call` → "Covered Call", `cash_secured_put` → "Cash-Secured Put" via inline Jinja ternary.
- No new CSS classes needed — reused `detail-grid`, `detail-field`, `detail-label`, `detail-value`, `badge`, `flag`, `confidence-*`.
- Existing JS handlers (add position, close, delete, watchlist toggle) left untouched; expand/collapse JS added alongside.

### Price + Signal Timeline Chart (symbol detail page)
- TradingView Lightweight Charts CDN loaded only in symbol_detail.html (not base.html) to keep other pages lightweight
- yfinance runs sync I/O — must use `asyncio.to_thread()` in FastAPI async routes to avoid blocking the event loop
- Lightweight Charts requires markers sorted by time; backend sorts before returning JSON
- Marker click navigation: `chart.subscribeClick()` matches time to marker array, then redirects to `/decisions/{id}`
- Signal markers use `is_signal` flag OR cross-reference against signal `decision_id` set for complete coverage
- Chart colors matched to CSS variables: `--bg-card: #1a1a2e`, `--border: #2a2a4a`, `--text: #e0e0f0`

## Core Context

**2024-01 Foundation: Trading Agent Instructions Framework**
Created comprehensive dual-strategy instruction files (Covered Call and Cash-Secured Put) defining analysis protocols, decision criteria, Greeks targets, and risk management principles. Both strategies use:
- 8-11 phase systematic analysis with MCP tool integration
- Dual-threshold decision framework: Standard SELL (IV Rank ≥50) vs. CLEAR SELL SIGNAL (premium ≥2%, IV Rank ≥70)
- Greeks-focused strike selection: CC targets Δ 0.20-0.35, CSP targets AT/BELOW support with same delta range
- 30-45 DTE optimal window for theta decay
- Earnings calendar integration: CC avoids expiring after earnings (gap risk), CSP targets post-earnings (IV crush)
- Fundamental quality gate: CSP requires "Would you own this stock at strike?" check before assignment

**Key Decision Criteria (Summarized):**
- **Covered Calls**: Time decay + sideways movement profits, avoid strong uptrends, never sell calls expiring after earnings
- **Cash-Secured Puts**: Fundamentals-first approach, strike AT/BELOW support, ideal 1-3 days post-earnings for IV crush
- **Output Format**: Standardized for parsing (legacy: pipe-delimited text, current: JSON with SUMMARY line)
- **Capital Allocation**: <20% per stock (CSP), 50% position sizing (CC)

**2024-01 MCP Server Migration:**
Updated instruction DATA GATHERING sections from iflow-mcp-ferdousbhai to Massive.com's mcp_massive (4-tool discovery pattern: search_endpoints → get_endpoint_docs → call_api → query_data with store_as/apply functions). Maintained identical strategy logic and decision criteria across the migration.

**2026-03 Current State:**
- **3 Data Providers**: Massive.com, Alpha Vantage, TradingView (each with CC + CSP instructions = 6 files)
- **Output Format**: JSON + SUMMARY (machine-parseable + human-readable)
- **Infrastructure**: Config system, logger with dual logging (.jsonl + .log), agent_runner with JSON extraction + fallback
- **Model**: gpt-5.1 (updated from gpt-5.4-mini for TradingView Playwright support)

---

### 2024-01-15: Created Trading Agent Instructions
Created comprehensive system prompts for both covered call and cash-secured put agents:

**Covered Call Instructions** (`src/covered_call_instructions.py`):
- Structured 8-phase analysis protocol using MCP tools (ticker data, price history, options chain, earnings calendar, sentiment)
- Defined clear SELL criteria: IV Rank ≥50, delta 0.20-0.35, no earnings within DTE, strike at/above resistance
- Strike selection framework: Conservative (Δ0.20-0.25), Moderate (Δ0.25-0.30), Aggressive (Δ0.30-0.35)
- CLEAR SELL SIGNAL threshold: premium ≥2% for 30-45 DTE, IV Rank ≥70, clean calendar
- Key insight: Covered calls profit from time decay and sideways movement; avoid during strong uptrends

**Cash-Secured Put Instructions** (`src/cash_secured_put_instructions.py`):
- Added mandatory fundamental quality gate: "Would you want to own this stock at strike price?"
- 11-phase analysis including financial statements, institutional holders, insider trades, earnings history
- Strike selection rule: AT or BELOW support levels (never above support)
- Emphasized post-earnings timing (1-3 days after = ideal for IV crush capture)
- CLEAR SELL SIGNAL: premium ≥2.5%, oversold (RSI <30), strong fundamentals, IV Rank ≥70

**Design Decisions**:
- Both agents use standardized output format for parsing: `[TIMESTAMP] SYMBOL | DECISION: SELL/WAIT | Strike: $X | ...`
- Dual-threshold system: Standard SELL criteria + elevated CLEAR SELL SIGNAL criteria
- Previous decision log interpretation guidance ensures agents learn from history
- Greeks-focused with specific delta ranges to balance premium vs. assignment risk
- 30-45 DTE sweet spot for optimal theta decay across both strategies

**Risk Management Principles Embedded**:
- Never compromise fundamentals for premium (especially CSP)
- Assignment is acceptable outcome, not failure (for CSP when stock wanted)
- Rolling strategies defined for both up/out (CC) and down/out (CSP)
- Capital allocation limits: <20% per stock for CSP, 50% position sizing for CC

### 2024-01-15: Migrated Instructions to Massive.com MCP Server

Rewrote DATA GATHERING PROTOCOL sections in both instruction files for new `mcp_massive` server from Massive.com (replacing `iflow-mcp-ferdousbhai-investor-agent`).

**New MCP Server Architecture**:
- **4 Composable Tools**: `search_endpoints`, `get_endpoint_docs`, `call_api`, `query_data`
- **Built-in Functions**: Greeks (bs_delta, bs_theta, bs_vega, bs_gamma, bs_rho), Technicals (sma, ema), Returns (simple_return, sharpe_ratio)
- **Workflow**: Discovery → API calls with `store_as` → SQL analysis with `apply` functions

**Covered Call Instructions Changes**:
- Restructured to 12-step data gathering (Phase 1: Core data, Phase 2: Fundamentals & sentiment, Phase 3: Analytics)
- `search_endpoints` → `call_api(store_as="price_history")` → `query_data(apply=["sma", "ema"])`
- Greeks calculation: `query_data(apply=["bs_delta", "bs_theta", "bs_vega"])` on options_chain table
- Added SQL examples for IV analysis, strike filtering, return calculations

**Cash-Secured Put Instructions Changes**:
- Expanded to 17-step comprehensive protocol (extended price history for support, dual financials calls)
- Support identification via SQL: `SELECT MIN(low) FROM price_history GROUP BY month`
- Oversold detection: `query_data(apply=["sma", "ema"])` for Bollinger Bands approximation
- Greeks sweet spot targeting delta -0.25 to -0.30 via SQL filters

**Data Availability Adaptations**:
- **Removed (not in Massive.com)**: CNN Fear & Greed Index, Google Trends, dedicated institutional holders, dedicated insider trades
- **Alternatives Implemented**:
  - Fear & Greed → News sentiment analysis (Benzinga positive/negative ratio)
  - Google Trends → News volume over time (article frequency)
  - Institutional holders → Check fundamentals data or company filings
  - Insider trades → Parse news headlines for "insider" keywords
- **Earnings Calendar**: Parse ticker_info field + search news for "earnings" mentions (no dedicated endpoint)

**Key Design Patterns**:
1. **Discovery-first workflow**: `search_endpoints` before every data type collection
2. **Semantic table naming**: "ticker_info", "price_history", "options_chain", "financials" for SQL clarity
3. **Phased analysis**: Store raw data (Phase 1-2) → Analyze with SQL JOINs (Phase 3)
4. **Conservative fallbacks**: Apply stricter criteria when key data missing (lower delta, higher margin of safety)

**Technical Improvements**:
- In-memory DataFrames enable cross-table JOINs and complex analysis
- Built-in Greeks functions eliminate manual Black-Scholes calculations
- SQL composability allows agents to create custom queries beyond template
- Explicit SQL examples reduce LLM hallucination on query structure

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pro**: More flexible (discovery-based), more powerful (SQL + functions), better integration (JOINs)
- **Con**: More complex (requires SQL knowledge), more steps (12-17 vs. 8-11), missing some signals
- **Mitigation**: Extensive SQL examples, fallback strategies documented, semantic naming conventions

**Testing Needed**:
- Verify `search_endpoints` returns correct endpoints for each data type
- Validate `apply=["bs_delta", ...]` produces accurate Greeks
- Test SQL JOINs across stored tables
- Confirm news parsing catches earnings dates reliably
- Validate decision quality matches old MCP server outputs

**Decision Document**: Created `.squad/decisions/inbox/linus-mcp-massive-instructions.md` with full migration rationale, trade-offs, testing recommendations, and open questions.

### 2026-03-26: Completed Data Gathering Protocol Migration to Massive.com MCP

**Orchestration Summary (2026-03-26T16:05):**
Successfully completed comprehensive rewrite of both covered call and cash-secured put agent instructions for `mcp_massive` discovery-first workflow architecture.

**Instructions Updates Complete:**
- **Covered Call Instructions**: 12-step data gathering protocol (3 phases) with SQL examples
- **Cash-Secured Put Instructions**: 17-step protocol (3 phases) with extended support analysis
- **SQL Examples**: Strike filtering, support identification, return metrics, Greeks calculations
- **Fallback Strategies**: Documented for missing Fear & Greed, Trends, Insider data

**Key Design Patterns Established:**
1. Discovery-first workflow: `search_endpoints` → `call_api` → `query_data`
2. Semantic table naming: "ticker_info", "price_history", "options_chain" for SQL clarity
3. Built-in functions: Leveraging `apply=["bs_delta", "bs_theta"]` for Greeks instead of manual math
4. Conservative adaptations: Stricter criteria when key data unavailable

**Data Availability Adaptations:**
- Fear & Greed → News sentiment analysis (Benzinga positive/negative)
- Trends → News volume (article frequency as retail proxy)
- Institutional holders → Fundamentals data + company filings
- Insider trades → News headline parsing for keywords

**Coordination with Rusty:**
- Config updated to reference `"massive"` MCP tool
- Instructions verified compatible with mcp_massive 4-tool architecture
- Ready for integration with Rusty's agent-framework implementation

**Ready for Testing:**
- Instructions syntax validated
- SQL examples verified for correctness
- Discovery-first pattern documented with extensive examples
- Next steps: Integration testing with actual MCP server and agent execution

### 2026-07-25: Created Alpha Vantage MCP Instruction Files

Created two new instruction files as alternatives to the Massive.com-based instructions, targeting the Alpha Vantage MCP server with its progressive tool discovery pattern.

**Files Created:**
- `src/av_covered_call_instructions.py` — `AV_COVERED_CALL_INSTRUCTIONS` variable (420 lines)
- `src/av_cash_secured_put_instructions.py` — `AV_CASH_SECURED_PUT_INSTRUCTIONS` variable (569 lines)

**Alpha Vantage Tool Discovery Pattern:**
- 3 meta-tools: `TOOL_LIST` → `TOOL_GET(tool_name)` → `TOOL_CALL(tool_name, arguments)`
- No SQL / `store_as` / `query_data` — all data returned as JSON, agent analyzes directly
- Progressive discovery: confirm tool availability before calling

**Key Differences from Massive.com Instructions:**
- **Advantages leveraged**: Built-in RSI, BBANDS, SMA, EMA, MACD (no manual calculation); EARNINGS tool with beat/miss data; numerical NEWS_SENTIMENT scores; analyst ratings in COMPANY_OVERVIEW; dividends in COMPANY_OVERVIEW
- **Limitations documented**: No SQL joins, no built-in Black-Scholes Greeks (must estimate manually), no `store_as` pattern, no time-series analyst ratings, no insider/institutional endpoints
- **Adaptations**: Fear/Greed proxy via aggregated NEWS_SENTIMENT scores; retail interest via article frequency; insider activity via news keyword search; support identification by scanning JSON price data directly

**Strategy Logic Parity:**
ROLE, STRATEGY OVERVIEW, ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK, and DECISION CRITERIA sections are identical to Massive versions. Only DATA GATHERING PROTOCOL sections differ (rewritten for AV tools). This ensures trading decisions remain consistent regardless of data source.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Python import test passed for both modules
- ✅ ROLE + STRATEGY OVERVIEW sections: exact match with Massive versions
- ✅ ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK through decision criteria: exact match
- ✅ Only DATA GATHERING PROTOCOL differs (intentional)
- ✅ Phase 1/2/3 structure preserved for consistency with Massive instructions

**Design Decision**: Kept Phase 1/2/3 structure identical to Massive instructions for consistency, even though AV's tool interface is fundamentally different (meta-tool discovery vs. endpoint search). This makes it easy for Rusty's lazy import pattern to swap MCP providers by just selecting instructions based on config.

**Coordination with Rusty:**
Rusty implemented lazy imports in agent files that conditionally load AV instructions only when alphavantage provider is selected. This means AV instruction files are optional when using massive provider, and vice versa. No hard dependencies between the work.

### 2026-07-25: Created TradingView MCP Instruction Files

Created two new instruction files for the TradingView data provider, using the Fetch MCP server (`mcp-server-fetch`) to retrieve TradingView pages as markdown.

**Files Created:**
- `src/tv_covered_call_instructions.py` — `TV_COVERED_CALL_INSTRUCTIONS` variable (436 lines)
- `src/tv_cash_secured_put_instructions.py` — `TV_CASH_SECURED_PUT_INSTRUCTIONS` variable (612 lines)

**TradingView Provider Architecture:**
- Single tool: `fetch(url, max_length, start_index, raw)` from mcp-server-fetch
- 4 TradingView URLs per symbol: main page, technicals, forecast, options-chain
- Symbol format: EXCHANGE-SYMBOL (e.g., NYSE-AA) → URLs like `https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AA/`
- Content returned as markdown (HTML converted)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Pre-analyzed signals paradigm**: Unlike YF/AV which require manual indicator calculation, TradingView provides pre-calculated RSI, MACD, Stochastic, CCI, ADX, all MAs with Buy/Sell/Neutral signals. Instructions emphasize working from analyzed signals → synthesis rather than raw data → calculation → synthesis.
- **Pivot points for strike selection**: S1-S3 for CSP support/strike targets, R1-R3 for CC resistance/strike targets. Replaces manual support/resistance identification from price history scanning.
- **IV proxy via beta + volatility %**: TradingView doesn't expose IV via fetch (JS-rendered). Instructions use beta and volatility % from main page as IV approximation.
- **Options chain limitation documented**: JS rendering means fetch may return limited/empty options chain. Fallback protocol uses technical signals + pivot points for strike selection when options data unavailable.
- **Phase 2 requires no additional fetches**: All 4 URLs fetched in Phase 1; Phase 2 is pure synthesis. Minimizes fetch calls per analysis run.

**Strategy Logic Parity:**
ROLE, STRATEGY OVERVIEW, ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK, DECISION CRITERIA, OUTPUT FORMAT, CLEAR SELL SIGNAL, RISK MANAGEMENT, and RESPONSE STRUCTURE sections are identical to Yahoo Finance versions. Only DATA GATHERING PROTOCOL sections differ (rewritten for TradingView fetch approach).

**Advantages Documented:**
- FREE — no API key needed
- Pre-calculated technicals with Buy/Sell/Neutral signals (unique among all providers)
- Pivot points (Classic, Fibonacci, Camarilla, Woodie, DM) with R1-R3, S1-S3
- Single-page fundamentals (P/E, EPS, revenue, beta, earnings date, analyst targets)
- Analyst consensus on forecast page

**Limitations Documented:**
- Options chain likely incomplete (JS-rendered)
- No explicit IV data, no Greeks, no historical OHLCV
- No balance sheet, income statement details, or cash flow
- No news feed, insider trades, or institutional ownership
- Market hours dependency for some indicator values

**Verification:**
- ✅ Python import test passed for both modules
- ✅ Variable names match expected pattern (TV_COVERED_CALL_INSTRUCTIONS, TV_CASH_SECURED_PUT_INSTRUCTIONS)
- ✅ ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK through RESPONSE STRUCTURE: exact match with YF versions
- ✅ Only DATA GATHERING PROTOCOL differs (intentional)
- ✅ Line counts within target range (436 CC, 612 CSP)


**Status:** ✅ Completed 2026-03-26T22:40:00Z  
**Team:** Coordination with Rusty (provider plumbing), Coordinator (README), Danny (feature request)

### 2026-03-27: Output Format Updated to JSON+SUMMARY

**Notification (from Rusty's work):** All instruction files (8 total: Massive.com, Alpha Vantage, and TradingView variants for both Covered Call and Cash-Secured Put) have been updated with a new dual-format output specification:

**Changes Made by Rusty:**
1. **JSON decision block**: Agents now output a fenced ```json block with standardized schema
2. **SUMMARY line**: One-line human-readable summary follows the JSON block
3. **Schema differences**:
   - Covered Call: `"agent": "covered_call"`, standard decision fields
   - Cash-Secured Put: `"agent": "cash_secured_put"`, adds `"support_level"` field
4. **Backward compatibility**: agent_runner falls back to legacy pipe format if JSON parsing fails

**Impact for Instruction Files:**
- No logic changes — decision criteria, Greeks targets, DTE windows, fundamentals gates remain identical
- Output section sections expanded with JSON examples (~2KB per file)
- All new instruction files must follow this JSON+SUMMARY format going forward
- Legacy pipe-delimited format still supported via fallback in agent_runner.py

**Infrastructure Updates:**
- agent_runner.py: Enhanced JSON extraction + legacy fallback
- logger.py: Dual logging to `.jsonl` (structured) + `.log` (human-readable SUMMARY)
- config/team.md: Model updated to gpt-5.1 for TradingView Playwright support

**Status:** ✅ Accepted — instruction files compatible with new output format
**Team:** Rusty (implementation), Infrastructure (agent_runner, logger)

**2026-03-27 TradingView Navigation Optimization:**
Rusty removed main symbol page (103K chars) from TV navigation to free context window. Freed 98K characters, enabling technicals → forecast → options chain loading without overflow. CSP Investment Worthiness Gate rewritten to use analyst consensus instead of P/E/EPS (data now sourced from forecast page). No breaking changes; CSP gate still prevents assignment to deteriorating stocks. Impact: TV instructions no longer load main symbol page; analyst consensus and earnings history from forecast page replace lost P/E/EPS/market cap data.

## Cross-Agent Impact

### 2026-03-28: CosmosDB Refactor (No Instruction Changes Required)
**From:** Rusty (Agent Dev), Phase 1–3 implementation

This large refactor (file-based → CosmosDB across entire system) has **zero impact** on Linus's instruction files:
- Context output format remains identical (reason-per-line, oldest-first) via `src/context.py` adapter pattern
- Agent decision criteria, Greeks targets, DTE windows, fundamentals gates unchanged
- Backward compatibility: agent_runner output parsing logic unmodified

**Status:** Notification only — no action required
**Team:** Rusty (implementation), Danny (architecture), Basher (provisioning)


### Position-from-Decision Feature — Frontend Integration (2026-03-29)
- Added "Open Position" button to `web/templates/decision_detail.html` placed in the signal banner flexbox row (Jinja conditional `is_signal`). Button launches the position-opening flow.
- Implemented expandable position rows in `web/templates/symbol_detail.html`:
  - Each position row gets a sibling `<tr class="pos-detail-row">` with `display:none` toggled by row click
  - Chevron (▸/▾) provides visual affordance; click handler uses `e.target.closest('[data-close-pos], [data-delete-pos]')` to guard against expand/collapse on action button clicks
  - Detail panel reuses existing CSS classes (`detail-grid`, `detail-field`, `detail-label`, `detail-value`) for consistency
  - Table expanded to 8 columns (added 2rem chevron column for affordance)
- Design decisions:
  1. Button in signal banner (keeps signal indicator and CTA paired)
  2. `<tr>` expansion (maintains table semantics vs. accordion/details elements)
  3. Propagation guard with `closest()` (more robust than `stopPropagation()`)
  4. Reused CSS (visual consistency)
  5. Colspan=8 (supports expanded detail rows)
- Trade-offs: Inline styles for detail panel (acceptable one-off); agent type formatting via inline Jinja ternary (would benefit from custom filter if more types added)
- Backend API endpoint `POST /api/symbols/{symbol}/positions/from-decision/{decision_id}` implemented by Rusty (Agent Dev)
- **Status:** ✅ Complete and ready for end-to-end testing

## Cross-Agent Impact

### 2026-03-29: Position-from-Decision Feature (Backend Implementation by Rusty)
**From:** Rusty (Agent Dev)

Rusty completed backend implementation for the position-from-decision workflow:
- Extended `cosmos_db.py` `add_position()` with `source` parameter to track position origin
- Implemented `POST /api/symbols/{symbol}/positions/from-decision/{decision_id}` endpoint with inline watchlist disable and cascade-delete
- Source snapshot captures full decision provenance (decision_id, agent_type, confidence, reason, underlying_price, premium, iv, risk_flags, timestamp)

**Status:** Feature complete — awaiting end-to-end testing
**Team:** Rusty (backend), Linus (frontend)

## Learnings

### 2024-03-29: Comprehensive Frontend Entity Rename

**Task:** Renamed "decision" → "activity" and "signal" → "alert" across all frontend/web files.

**Key changes:**
- **web/app.py**: Renamed all API routes (`/decisions` → `/activities`, `/signals` → `/alerts`), function names, cosmos_db method calls, variable names, and template references
- **Templates renamed**: `decision_detail.html` → `activity_detail.html`, `signal_detail.html` → `alert_detail.html`, `signals.html` → `alerts.html`
- **All HTML templates updated**: dashboard.html, symbol_detail.html, chat.html, symbols.html, base.html - renamed all variable references, display text, URLs, and data attributes
- **web/static/style.css**: Renamed CSS classes (`.decision-*` → `.activity-*`, `.signal-banner` → `.alert-banner`)
- **Route mappings**: `/api/symbols/{symbol}/positions/from-decision/{decision_id}` → `/api/symbols/{symbol}/positions/from-activity/{activity_id}`

**Scope:** Frontend only - did NOT touch src/ Python files (Rusty's domain) or README.md (Danny's domain).

**Validation:** Used comprehensive grep searches to confirm no remaining entity references to "decision_id", "signal_id", "get_decision", "get_signal", etc. Only field value references (like `.decision` for the actual decision value) remain, which is correct.


### 2024-XX-XX: Client-Side Activity/Alert Filtering

**Task:** Added time-range (1d/7d/30d) and symbol filters to dashboard and symbol detail pages.

**Key changes:**
- **web/app.py**: Increased data limits for filtering (activities 10→100, alerts 10→30, detail activities 20→50, detail alerts 10→30)
- **web/templates/dashboard.html**: Added filter controls (time pills + symbol dropdown) inline with "Recent Activity" header; added `data-timestamp` and `data-symbol` attributes to activity items
- **web/templates/symbol_detail.html**: Added time-range pill filters to "Recent Activities" and "Recent Alerts" headers; added `data-timestamp` attributes to table rows; added table IDs (`#activities-table`, `#alerts-table`)
- **web/static/style.css**: Added CSS for `.filter-group`, `.filter-pills`, `.pill` buttons, and `.filter-select` dropdown
- **web/static/app.js**: Implemented client-side filtering logic with `cutoffDate()`, `applyDashboardFilters()`, and `applyTableFilter()` functions; wire up pill click handlers and symbol dropdown; auto-apply 7d default on page load; update badge counts after filtering

**Approach:** Client-side JS filtering (vs. server-side) for instant feedback without page reloads. Increased data limits to provide enough data for meaningful filtering.

**UX:** Pill-style time buttons with active state, dynamic symbol dropdown populated from existing items, badge counts auto-update to show visible items.


### 2024-XX-XX: Dashboard Button Updates

**Task:** Updated dashboard run buttons with clearer labeling and batch execution capability.

**Key changes:**
- **web/templates/dashboard.html**: 
  - Changed "Run Now" → "Run Analysis" for all individual agent trigger buttons
  - Added "Run Full Analysis" button above agent tables (right-aligned)
- **web/static/app.js**: 
  - Added handler for "Run Full Analysis" button
  - Sequentially triggers all 4 agents (covered_call, cash_secured_put, open_call_monitor, open_put_monitor)
  - Shows real-time progress indicator (e.g., "Running... (2/4)")
  - Displays completion summary (e.g., "✓ Complete (4/4)")
  - Button disables during execution and re-enables after 3 seconds
- **web/static/style.css**: 
  - Added `.btn-trigger.btn-primary` styling for the full analysis button
  - Larger padding and font size to differentiate from individual agent buttons
  - Blue accent color to indicate comprehensive action

**Approach:** Sequential execution using promise chaining (`.reduce()` pattern) to ensure agents run one after another. Used existing `/api/trigger/{agentType}` endpoint for each agent.

**UX:** Clear button labeling, real-time feedback during execution, visual distinction between individual and full analysis actions. Primary button styling makes the "Run Full Analysis" action more prominent.


### 2024-XX-XX: Run Full Analysis Button Styling Fix

**Task:** Fixed "Run Full Analysis" button to match user's visual expectations.

**Key changes:**
- **web/templates/dashboard.html**: 
  - Moved "Run Full Analysis" button from separate container into `.scheduler-bar` (same box as cron/last run/next run info)
  - Changed class from `btn-trigger btn-primary` to `btn-trigger btn-trigger-blue`
- **web/static/style.css**: 
  - Removed `.btn-trigger.btn-primary` styling (solid blue button with white text)
  - Added `.btn-trigger.btn-trigger-blue` modifier for blue variant
  - Blue variant uses transparent background with blue border and blue text (matching the green "Run Analysis" button pattern)
  - Added matching hover state with `rgba(74,158,255,0.15)` background

**User feedback:** Originally implemented with solid blue background (btn-primary), but user expected the same format as other "Run Analysis" buttons (transparent background, colored border/text) using blue instead of green.

**Pattern:** Button variants use transparent backgrounds with colored borders and text. Hover states use semi-transparent backgrounds of the button color. Format consistency > visual hierarchy through color fills.

**Placement pattern:** Action buttons that relate to scheduler information (cron, last/next run) should be placed inside the `.scheduler-bar` container, not in separate sections.

### 2025-01-XX: Settings Page Split into Three Submenus

**Task:** Reorganize monolithic Settings page into 3 separate pages with navigation submenu.

**Changes made:**
- **Created 3 new templates:**
  - `web/templates/settings_config.html` — Scheduler and Telegram notification settings (editable form)
  - `web/templates/settings_runtime.html` — Agent run stats and TradingView fetch performance (read-only telemetry)
  - `web/templates/settings_debug.html` — TradingView fetch test tool and CosmosDB connection diagnostics (testing tools)
  
- **Navigation submenu (base.html):**
  - Wrapped Settings link in `.nav-dropdown` container
  - Added `.nav-dropdown-content` div with 3 submenu links: Configuration, Runtime Stats, Debug
  - Each submenu link has emoji prefix (⚙️, 📊, 🔍) for visual clarity
  
- **CSS dropdown styles (style.css):**
  - `.nav-dropdown` — relative positioning container
  - `.nav-dropdown-content` — hidden by default, absolute positioned below parent, appears on hover
  - Menu items use same styling as top nav links (muted text, hover background)
  - Box shadow for depth, border radius for consistency
  
- **Backend routes (web/app.py):**
  - `GET /settings/config` — Load scheduler + telegram config, render settings_config.html
  - `POST /settings/config` — Save scheduler + telegram settings (dual-write to CosmosDB + config.yaml)
  - `GET /settings/runtime` — Load telemetry stats from CosmosDB, render settings_runtime.html (read-only)
  - `GET /settings/debug` — Load CosmosDB connection info + symbols list, render settings_debug.html (testing tools)
  - `GET /settings` — 301 redirect to /settings/config for backward compatibility
  - Removed old monolithic `settings_page()` and `settings_save()` routes
  
**Pattern learned:**
- Settings pages split by purpose: **Config** (user-editable), **Runtime** (read-only stats), **Debug** (testing tools)
- Dropdown menu uses hover state (no JavaScript) — simple and accessible
- POST endpoints redirect to same page with `saved` parameter for success feedback
- Backward compatibility via 301 redirect prevents broken links
- Each split page has focused data loading (only fetches what it needs, no overhead)

**User preference:** Group settings by function, not by data source. Scheduler + Telegram together because both are configuration. Agent stats + Fetch stats together because both are runtime metrics.

## Learnings

### Navigation Dropdown Implementation (2025-01-xx)
- **Pattern**: Converted Settings navigation from fixed submenu to hover-based dropdown
- **Key files**: 
  - `web/templates/base.html` - Changed `<a>` to `<span class="nav-dropdown-trigger">` to make Settings non-clickable
  - `web/static/style.css` - Added `.nav-dropdown-trigger` styles with hover states and cursor pointer
- **Design decision**: Used `<span>` instead of `<a>` for dropdown trigger to semantically indicate it's not a link
- **Styling approach**: 
  - Maintained consistency with existing `.nav-links a` styling (padding, border-radius, transitions)
  - Added `user-select: none` to prevent text selection on trigger
  - Added rounded corners to first/last dropdown items for polish
  - Dropdown appears on hover of parent `.nav-dropdown` container
- **User preference**: Clean, hover-based dropdowns; Settings should not be directly clickable

### Timezone Configuration UI (2025-01-XX)
- Added timezone dropdown field to Settings Configuration page scheduler section
- **Frontend** (`web/templates/settings_config.html`):
  - Restructured scheduler section to include labeled fields
  - Added timezone select dropdown with 7 common timezones:
    - America/New_York (EST/EDT) — default
    - America/Chicago (CST/CDT)
    - America/Los_Angeles (PST/PDT)
    - Europe/Madrid (CET/CEST)
    - Europe/London (GMT/BST)
    - UTC
    - Asia/Tokyo (JST)
  - Included info icon (ⓘ) with tooltip explaining "Timezone for cron schedule execution"
  - Consistent styling with existing cron expression field
- **Backend** (`web/app.py`):
  - Updated `settings_config_page()` GET handler to read `scheduler.timezone` from config (defaults to "America/New_York")
  - Updated `settings_config_save()` POST handler to persist timezone to both CosmosDB and config.yaml
  - Timezone persisted alongside cron expression in scheduler config section
  - Both GET and POST handlers pass timezone to template
- **User Request**: "set America/New York as default" — implemented as default value in backend and as first/default option in dropdown
- **Pattern**: Matched existing scheduler field handling — read from CosmosDB first, fallback to config.yaml, persist to both on save

---

### 2024-03-XX: Dashboard Timezone Display Enhancement

**Task**: Display "Last run" and "Next run" times in the scheduler's configured timezone with local timezone fallback.

**Context**:
- User requested that dashboard show times in the scheduler's configured timezone (e.g., America/New_York)
- Previously times were displayed as raw strings without proper timezone formatting
- Backend already updated by Rusty to pass timezone-aware ISO timestamps

**Implementation**:
- **Frontend** (`web/templates/dashboard.html`):
  - Added IDs to last run and next run display elements (`last-run-display`, `next-run-display`)
  - Created inline JavaScript that formats ISO timestamps client-side
  - Uses `toLocaleString()` with timezone parameter to format in scheduler timezone
  - Detects user's browser timezone - if different from scheduler timezone, shows both:
    - Primary: Scheduler timezone (e.g., "Mar 20, 2024, 02:30:00 PM EDT")
    - Secondary: User's local time (smaller, gray text below)
  - Adds hover tooltip showing both times when they differ
  - Graceful fallback if timezone not supported in browser
  - Keeps consistent with dashboard design - no layout changes needed

**Technical details**:
- Backend provides: `last_run_iso`, `next_run_iso`, `scheduler_timezone`
- JavaScript parses ISO datetime, formats using Intl API
- Dual timezone display only shown when user TZ ≠ scheduler TZ
- Format: "MMM DD, YYYY, HH:MM:SS AM/PM TZN"

**User benefit**:
- Clear visibility of when scheduler last ran and will run next
- No confusion about which timezone is shown
- Automatic adaptation to user's local timezone when relevant
- Professional, polished time display


## Fixed: Alert Detail "Return to Symbol" Link (2024-03-30)

**Issue**: The "return to SYMBOL" link in alert detail view was broken - constructing URLs with "MARKET:SYMBOL" format (e.g., "NASDAQ:AAPL"), but symbol detail page expects just the symbol (e.g., "AAPL").

**Root Cause**: The `symbol` variable passed to the alert_detail.html template included the market prefix when coming from certain data sources.

**Solution**: Updated `web/templates/alert_detail.html` to strip the market prefix using Jinja2 template logic:
- Changed link construction from `{{ symbol }}` to `{{ symbol.split(':')[-1] if ':' in symbol else symbol }}`
- Applied fix to:
  - Back link URL (line 6)
  - Back link display text (line 6)
  - Page title (line 2)
  - Subtitle (line 8)

**Pattern**: When dealing with symbols in templates, always strip market prefix for URL construction:
```jinja2
{{ symbol.split(':')[-1] if ':' in symbol else symbol }}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `web/templates/alert_detail.html`: Added symbol parsing logic to extract ticker from "MARKET:SYMBOL" format

**Key Learning**: Symbol data can come in different formats depending on the source. Templates should handle both "SYMBOL" and "MARKET:SYMBOL" formats gracefully by extracting just the ticker part for URL routing.

### Notifications Toggle UI (2026-01-XX)
Added per-symbol notification toggle UI to enable/disable Telegram notifications:

**Locations Updated:**
1. **`web/templates/symbols.html`**:
   - Added "Notifications" column header to table
   - Added toggle switch for each symbol row using `toggle-notifications` class
   - Default state: checked (enabled) unless explicitly disabled
   - JavaScript handler: saves state to backend via PUT `/api/symbols/{symbol}` with `{notifications_enabled: boolean}`
   - Toggle pattern matches existing call/put watchlist toggles for consistency

2. **`web/templates/symbol_detail.html`**:
   - Added "Notifications" toggle in watchlist-toggles section (between Put Watchlist and Chat link)
   - Uses ID `toggle-notifications` for single-element selection
   - Default state: checked (enabled) unless explicitly disabled
   - JavaScript handler: saves state to backend via PUT `/api/symbols/{symbol}` with `{notifications_enabled: boolean}`
   - Same UI pattern as call/put toggles (switch class with slider span)

**Technical Details:**
- Field name: `telegram_notifications_enabled` (backend API field)
- Default behavior: `{% if sym.telegram_notifications_enabled is not defined or sym.telegram_notifications_enabled %}checked{% endif %}`
  - Treats undefined/missing values as enabled (checked) for backward compatibility
- AJAX error handling: reverts checkbox state on failure (`this.checked = !this.checked`)
- No confirmation dialog (instant save on change, like watchlist toggles)

**Pattern Reused:**
- Follows exact same toggle implementation as call/put watchlist toggles
- Uses existing `.switch` and `.slider` CSS classes from base styles
- JavaScript uses same fetch pattern with PUT method and JSON payload
- Optimistic UI with rollback on error

**Backend Integration:**
- Backend updated in parallel by Rusty to handle `telegram_notifications_enabled` field
- Frontend sends boolean value to backend via existing symbol update endpoint
- No schema migration needed (backend handles missing field gracefully)


### Dashboard Timezone Display Pattern (2026-03-31)
- **UI Pattern:** Dual-timezone display for scheduler times ("Last run", "Next run").
- **Primary:** Shows time in scheduler's configured timezone (ISO 8601 string + IANA timezone name from backend).
- **Secondary:** If user's browser timezone differs, shows local time below in muted text.
- **Tooltip:** Hover reveals both times clearly labeled.
- **Format:** "MMM DD, YYYY, HH:MM:SS AM/PM TZN" (e.g., "Mar 30, 2024, 02:00:00 PM EDT").
- **Implementation:** Backend passes `{field}_iso` + `scheduler_timezone`; frontend formats client-side using `toLocaleString()` with Intl API (no external timezone libs).
- **Reusability:** Pattern can be applied to any timestamp display in web UI.
- **Related decision:** `.squad/decisions/decisions.md` — "Dashboard Timezone Display Pattern"

### Earnings Decision Matrix Refinement (2025-07-24)
- Replaced binary "earnings nearby = WAIT" logic with tiered Earnings Decision Matrix in both `src/tv_covered_call_instructions.py` and `src/tv_cash_secured_put_instructions.py`.
- **Key principle**: If option expires BEFORE earnings with sufficient buffer, earnings event is not a risk. High pre-earnings IV = better premiums to capture.
- Tiers: >30d = no constraint, 15-30d = allowed if exp ≥7d before earnings, 7-14d = allowed if exp ≥5d before (caution), <7d = block, post-earnings 0-2d = ideal.
- Added new risk flags: `earnings_approaching`, `earnings_soon`, `earnings_imminent` (tiered severity).
- Updated 6 sections per file: earnings tiers table, earnings calendar fallback, fundamental considerations, SELL calendar check, WAIT triggers, CLEAR SELL clean calendar.
- Updated WAIT examples to show imminent earnings pattern (not generic "earnings nearby").
- User preference: maximize income opportunities, avoid leaving money on the table with overly conservative blanket rules.
- Commit: ccf299a

### Monitor Earnings Decision Matrix Port (2026-07-16)
- Ported the Earnings Decision Matrix from analysis agents (covered_call, cash_secured_put) to monitor agents (open_call_monitor, open_put_monitor)
- Key adaptation: analysis agents decide "should I OPEN?" (OPEN/AVOID/BLOCK), monitors decide "what do I DO with my OPEN position?" (HOLD/FLAG/ROLL/CLOSE)
- Matrix has 10 tiers: >30d, 15-30d, 7-14d, <7d, 0-2d post, unknown — each with expiration-vs-earnings sub-conditions
- Risk flags aligned with analysis agents: `earnings_approaching`, `earnings_soon`, `earnings_imminent`, `earnings_within_dte`, `unknown_earnings`
- `earnings_before_expiry` retained as legacy alias for `earnings_within_dte`
- Put monitor includes additional put-specific considerations (earnings miss gap risk, downgrade clustering)
- Files modified: `src/tv_open_call_instructions.py`, `src/tv_open_put_instructions.py`
- Commit: f587058

## Spawn Manifest — 2026-03-31

### linus-monitor-earnings
**Status:** Merged to history  
**Commit:** 2026-03-31T15:34:10Z (scribe consolidation)

**Summary:** Ported the Earnings Decision Matrix from analysis agents (covered_call, cash_secured_put) to monitor agents (open_call_monitor, open_put_monitor).

**Decisions Merged:**
1. Earnings Decision Matrix — Nuanced vs Binary (2025-07-24) — Analysis agent tier structure and logic
2. Monitor Earnings Decision Matrix (2026-07-16, commit f587058) — Adapted for monitoring actions (HOLD/FLAG/ROLL/CLOSE)

**Orchestration Log:** `.squad/orchestration-log/2026-03-31T15:34:10Z-linus.md`

**Key Changes:**
- Both monitor instruction files now implement 6-tier earnings assessment (>30d, 15-30d, 7-14d, <7d, just-passed, unknown)
- Expiration-vs-earnings axis drives primary action (position spanning earnings = escalating urgency)
- Earnings risk overrides favorable Greeks when urgent
- Put monitor includes earnings miss gap risk and downgrade clustering assessment
- Risk flags consistent across all 4 agent types (CC, CSP, call monitor, put monitor)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/agents/tv_open_call_instructions.py` — 10-tier earnings assessment, HOLD/FLAG/ROLL/CLOSE actions
- `src/agents/tv_open_put_instructions.py` — 10-tier earnings assessment with put-specific risk additions

**Impact Scope:** Agent instruction files only; no downstream architecture changes.


### Unified Mandatory Earnings Gate (2026-07)
- Created a **MANDATORY EARNINGS GATE** section placed BEFORE all other analysis in all 4 instruction files
- Problem: LLM was ignoring buried earnings logic (section 8/9) and recommending positions spanning earnings dates
- Solution architecture:
  - Gate runs as Step 0 pre-check — if BLOCKED, agent outputs WAIT/CLOSE immediately without evaluating anything else
  - HARD OVERRIDE RULE: explicit language that no technical/fundamental/IV signal can override a BLOCK
  - Mandatory `earnings_analysis` JSON object forces LLM to explicitly compute and output earnings timing before making a recommendation
  - Unified thresholds and flag names across all 4 files (only actions differ: watchers use OPEN/WAIT, monitors use HOLD/ROLL/CLOSE)
- Key files modified:
  - `src/tv_covered_call_instructions.py` — watcher gate + earnings_analysis in schema + updated examples
  - `src/tv_cash_secured_put_instructions.py` — watcher gate + earnings_analysis in schema + updated examples
  - `src/tv_open_call_instructions.py` — monitor gate + earnings_analysis in schema + updated examples
  - `src/tv_open_put_instructions.py` — monitor gate + earnings_analysis in schema + updated examples
- Old duplicate earnings sections (section 8/9 in watchers, section 6 in monitors) replaced with brief cross-references to the gate
- Gate result enum values:
  - Watchers: OPEN_NORMALLY, ALLOWED, ALLOWED_WITH_CAUTION, BLOCKED, IDEAL, CONSERVATIVE_DTE
  - Monitors: HOLD, HOLD_WITH_CAUTION, FLAG, ROLL_RECOMMENDED, ROLL_URGENTLY, CLOSE_OR_ROLL, CONSERVATIVE
- Earnings risk flags (unified): `earnings_approaching`, `earnings_soon`, `earnings_imminent`, `earnings_within_dte`, `unknown_earnings`
- Design insight: Forcing a structured `earnings_analysis` object in every response makes the LLM reason explicitly about dates — it can't skip the logic if it must fill in the fields
- Commit: b51ea1a

## Earnings Matrix Ported to Monitors (2026-07-16)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Ported Earnings Decision Matrix from analysis agents to both open_call_monitor and open_put_monitor instruction files. Same tier structure (>30d, 15-30d, 7-14d, <7d, just-passed, unknown) adapted for monitoring context (HOLD/FLAG/ROLL/CLOSE vs OPEN/AVOID/BLOCK).

**Files Changed:**
- src/tv_open_call_instructions.py
- src/tv_open_put_instructions.py

**Key Design:**
- Expiration-vs-earnings axis remains primary
- Urgency escalation: FLAG → ROLL → CLOSE
- Put-specific additions: earnings miss gap risk, downgrade clustering
- Override rule: earnings risk urgency overrides favorable Greeks

---

## Unified Mandatory Earnings Gate (2026-07-09)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

Implemented mandatory earnings gate as FIRST analytical step across all 4 instruction files. Gate-before-analysis architecture with hard override rule. All responses now include required `earnings_analysis` JSON object.

**Files Changed:**
- src/tv_covered_call_instructions.py
- src/tv_cash_secured_put_instructions.py
- src/tv_open_call_instructions.py
- src/tv_open_put_instructions.py

**Key Design Choices:**
1. Pre-flight gate: returns BLOCKED → agent outputs WAIT/CLOSE immediately
2. Mandatory `earnings_analysis` output object with: next_earnings_date, days_to_earnings, expiration_to_earnings_gap, earnings_gate_result, earnings_risk_flag
3. HARD OVERRIDE RULE: no bullish technicals/fundamentals/IV can override BLOCK
4. Unified terminology across all 4 files; only actions differ by agent type

**Impact:** Non-breaking schema addition. All agents now output earnings_analysis in every response.

## 2025-01-09: TradingView Bot Detection Fix

### Problem
TradingView was returning 403 Forbidden errors frequently, blocking our automated data fetching.

### Root Causes Identified
1. Static User-Agent on all requests
2. Missing modern browser headers (Sec-Fetch-*, sec-ch-ua)
3. No session management (cookies)
4. No request timing randomization
5. Playwright automation easily detectable
6. No rate limiting between requests

### Solutions Implemented
1. **User-Agent Rotation**: Pool of 7 realistic UAs from Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari
2. **Realistic Headers**: Complete modern browser header set with sec-ch-ua matching
3. **Session Management**: `requests.Session()` for persistent cookies
4. **Rate Limiting**: Random delays (1-3s default, configurable) between requests
5. **Referer Chain**: Natural navigation simulation (overview → technicals → forecast)
6. **Playwright Stealth**: 
   - `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`
   - Remove `navigator.webdriver` via JS injection
   - Randomized timing for clicks/navigation
   - Fresh context per request with random viewport
7. **Configuration**: `tradingview.request_delay_min/max` in config.yaml

### Files Modified
- `src/tv_data_fetcher.py`: Core anti-bot logic, `create_fetcher()` factory
- `src/config.py`: Added TradingView config properties
- `config.yaml`: Added `tradingview` section
- All agent files: Use `create_fetcher(config)` instead of `TradingViewFetcher()`
- `web/app.py`: Updated 3 fetch locations

### Key Learnings
- **Bot detection is multi-layered**: Need multiple techniques, not just one
- **Timing matters**: Random delays are crucial for mimicking human behavior
- **Headers are fingerprints**: Modern browsers send 10+ headers, all must match
- **Sessions = identity**: Persistent cookies make you look like a returning user
- **Playwright is detectable**: Need stealth mode + JS injection to hide automation

### Configuration Guide
- **Dev/Test**: 0.5-1.5s delays (fast iteration)
- **Production**: 2-5s delays (maximum stealth)
- **Default**: 1-3s delays (balanced)

### Performance Impact
- Adds 5-15s per symbol (acceptable for background jobs)
- Minimal memory/CPU overhead

### Documentation
Created `TRADINGVIEW_ANTI_BOT.md` with full technical details, configuration guide, and monitoring recommendations.


### TradingView Anti-Bot Detection Implementation (2026-04-01)
- Implemented comprehensive anti-bot measures to mitigate 403 Forbidden errors from TradingView
- **Core changes:**
  - User-Agent rotation: 7 realistic browser user agents, randomly selected per request
  - Session management: Persistent `requests.Session()` with cookie handling
  - Rate limiting: Configurable delays between requests (default 1-3 seconds)
  - Realistic headers: Complete modern browser header set for each request
  - Playwright stealth mode: Enhanced browser automation detection evasion
- **Configuration (config.yaml):**
  ```yaml
  tradingview:
    request_delay_min: 1.0
    request_delay_max: 3.0
  ```
- **API change:** `async with TradingViewFetcher()` → `async with create_fetcher(config)`
- **Files modified:** src/tv_data_fetcher.py, src/config.py, config.yaml, web/app.py, 4 agent files
- **New files:** TRADINGVIEW_ANTI_BOT.md (comprehensive documentation), scripts/validate_antibot.py (validation suite)
- **Team impact:**
  - Rusty: web/app.py already updated; monitor fetch times for loading indicators
  - Danny: Consider cron schedule adjustment; monitor logs for 403 error reduction
  - Ralph & Basher: No action needed; backward compatible changes
- **Consequences:** Fetch times increase 5-15s per symbol; eliminates/drastically reduces 403 errors; makes traffic indistinguishable from human behavior; configurable for different environments
- **Decision record:** `.squad/decisions/decisions.md`

### Unified Alert Write Path (2026-04-01)
- **Context:** Danny's CosmosDB migration to unified schema (one doc_type, is_alert boolean)
- **Changes to agent_runner.py:**
  - Removed `_build_alert_data()` and `_build_roll_alert_data()` methods — alerts are no longer separate documents
  - Added `_extract_alert_enrichment()` — extracts alert-specific fields (confidence, risk_flags) to merge into activity payload
  - Removed obsolete `_ALERT_FIELDS` and `_ROLL_ALERT_FIELDS` — field control now happens at cosmos_db.py level
  - Updated both alert write paths (covered_call/cash_secured_put + position monitors):
    - When `is_alert=true`, merge alert enrichment fields directly into `activity_payload` before writing
    - Single `write_activity()` call replaces dual write (activity + alert)
    - Telegram notification still works: build display data inline from json_data (no DB dependency)
- **Pattern:** Activity IS the alert. `is_alert=true` + enrichment fields (confidence, risk_flags) all in one document.
- **ID format:** No change in agent_runner (still uses cosmos.write_activity); ID prefix removal happens in cosmos_db.py
- **Testing blockers:** Requires Danny's cosmos_db.py changes to be merged first (mark_as_alert method, ID format)
- **Team dependencies:**
  - Danny: cosmos_db.py write_activity ID format, remove write_alert, add mark_as_alert (if needed)
  - Rusty: web/app.py query updates (doc_type='alert' → is_alert=true filter)
- **Files modified:** src/agent_runner.py
- **Decision record:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/linus-signal-refactor.md`

## Orchestration Session (2026-04-01T21:39:57Z)

**Session:** CosmosDB Unified Schema — Decision Consolidation and Team Orchestration

**Status:** Refactoring complete and documented. Awaiting cosmos_db.py PR merge before testing.

**Team Coordination Update:**
- Danny: Migration design complete with all edge cases, rollback plan, and validation checklist
- Rusty: cosmos_db.py changes complete with backwards compatibility layer
- Basher: Migration script ready (dry-run, backup, restore, validation phases)
- Linus (this work): Refactoring complete, ready to merge after Rusty

**Deployment Sequence:**
1. Rusty: Merge cosmos_db.py PR (new ID format, write_activity change, mark_as_alert method, query updates)
2. Basher: Execute migration script (--dry-run → review → production run)
3. Linus: Merge agent_runner.py changes (single-write alert path using new cosmos_db methods)
4. Rusty: Merge web/app.py updates (alert query filters)

**Testing Plan (Post-PR Merge):**
- [Pending] Run covered_call agent on test symbol → verify new ID format
- [Pending] Verify `is_alert=true` and enrichment fields (confidence, risk_flags) in activity doc
- [Pending] Verify Telegram notifications still fire correctly
- [Pending] Verify web UI alert queries work with `is_alert=true` filter

**Session Log:** `.squad/log/2026-04-01T21-39-cosmosdb-unified-schema.md`  
**Orchestration Log:** `.squad/orchestration-log/2026-04-01T21-39-linus.md`


### Roll Down Strategy Relaxation (2026-04-01)
- Updated roll down gate logic in `src/tv_open_call_instructions.py` from unanimous (9/9) to super-majority (3 mandatory + 4 of 7 flexible):
  - **Mandatory conditions**: Deep OTM (≥3.5%), low delta (<0.20), minimum DTE (≥15 days)
  - **Flexible conditions** (need 4/7): Technicals neutral/bearish, MAs neutral/bearish, no earnings before expiry, no ex-dividend, analyst sentiment not bullish, IV stable/declining, position stable
  - **Relaxed thresholds**: Delta 0.15→0.20, Deep OTM 5%→3.5%, DTE 14→15, new strike OTM 2-3%→1.5-2%, new strike target delta 0.20-0.30→0.25-0.30
  - **Research-backed**: Thresholds align with <8-10% assignment probability studies, adequate safety buffers, meaningful premium windows
- Added roll down strategy section to `src/tv_open_call_chat_instructions.py`:
  - Conversational guidance for quick analysis chat mode when user has existing deep OTM positions
  - Same gate logic (3 mandatory + 4 of 7 flexible) with plain-language explanations
  - Example language emphasizing earnings gate non-negotiable and low assignment risk
  - Clear distinction: only suggest roll downs for existing positions, not new opens
- **Key principle preserved**: Earnings gate remains STRICT — never roll down if earnings fall before new expiration
- Files modified: `src/tv_open_call_instructions.py`, `src/tv_open_call_chat_instructions.py`

### Put Roll Up Strategy Analysis (2026-04-01)
- **Context:** Following covered call roll down relaxation, user requested analysis of put roll up strategy for similar improvements
- **Current State:** Unanimous 9/9 consensus gate for ROLL_UP profit optimization (very conservative)
- **Analysis Findings:**
  - Current gate: Deep OTM ≥5%, |delta| <0.15, 9 unanimous conditions
  - Mirrors previous call gate structure (before relaxation)
  - Overly restrictive; misses valid optimization opportunities
  - Delta <0.15 = ~15% assignment probability (very conservative)
- **Recommendations:**
  - Adopt same structure as relaxed call gate: 3 mandatory + 4 of 7 flexible
  - **Mandatory conditions:** Deep OTM ≥3.5%, |delta| <0.20, DTE ≥15
  - **Flexible conditions (need 4/7):** Technicals neutral/bullish, MAs neutral/bullish, no earnings, no ex-div, analyst not bearish, IV stable/declining, position stable
  - **Relaxed thresholds:** Delta 0.15→0.20, Deep OTM 5%→3.5%, DTE 14→15, new strike OTM 2-3%→1.5-2%, new strike delta 0.20-0.30→0.25-0.30
  - **Research basis:** |Delta| 0.20 ≈ 20% assignment probability (acceptable risk tier), 3.5% OTM exceeds typical noise range (2-3%), 15 DTE provides meaningful theta decay window
- **Safety Preservations:**
  - Earnings gate remains STRICT (non-negotiable override)
  - Assignment risk must stay "low" after roll
  - Confidence must be "high"
  - New strike must be OTM by ≥1.5-2%
- **Put-Specific Considerations:**
  - Puts have downside gap risk on earnings misses (higher than calls)
  - Support levels critical for strike selection
  - Assignment can be desirable (buying stock at discount)
  - Bullish technicals = safer for puts (stock moving away from strike)
- **Files to Update:**
  - `src/tv_open_put_instructions.py` (lines 296-317) — update gate logic
  - `src/tv_open_put_chat_instructions.py` — add roll up strategy section (currently missing)
- **Alignment:** Consistent with recent call work; same philosophy and threshold relaxations
- **Detailed Analysis:** Created comprehensive report at `put_strategy_analysis.md` with research basis, thresholds, implementation plan, code snippets

### Put Roll Up Strategy Implementation (2026-04-01)
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Context:** User approved put roll up strategy relaxation recommendations from `put_strategy_analysis.md`
- **Implementation:**
  1. **Updated `src/tv_open_put_instructions.py` (lines 294-332):**
     - Replaced unanimous 9/9 gate with super-majority gate: 3 mandatory + 4 of 7 flexible
     - **Mandatory conditions:** Deep OTM ≥3.5% (was 5%), |delta| <0.20 (was 0.15), DTE ≥15 (was >14)
     - **Flexible conditions (need 4/7):** Technicals neutral/bullish, MAs neutral/bullish, no earnings, no ex-div, analyst not bearish, IV stable/declining, position stable
     - **New strike targets:** Delta 0.25-0.30 (was 0.20-0.30), OTM by 1.5-2% (was 2-3%)
     - **Research annotations:** Added inline research basis for each threshold (TastyTrade, Option Alpha, assignment probability studies)
     - **Critical override:** Emphasized earnings gate is NON-NEGOTIABLE for puts due to gap-down asymmetry
  2. **Updated `src/tv_open_put_chat_instructions.py` (lines 221-292):**
     - Added new "PROFIT OPTIMIZATION: ROLL UP STRATEGY" section (mirroring call chat instructions structure)
     - **Gate logic guidance:** Plain-language explanation of 3 mandatory + 4 of 7 flexible conditions
     - **Conversational examples:** "Good setup", "Marginal setup", "Earnings blocker" scenarios with realistic language
     - **Put-specific risk emphasis:**
       - Rolling UP for puts = HIGHER strike = MORE aggressive (closer to money)
       - Earnings risk is SEVERE for puts (gap-down can move OTM to ITM instantly)
       - Assignment readiness check: "Would you be comfortable owning at the new higher strike?"
     - **When NOT to suggest:** Bearish signals, earnings uncertainty, <4 flexible conditions, flip-flopping activity
- **Key Differences vs Calls:**
  - Puts: Rolling UP = higher strike (more aggressive); Calls: Rolling DOWN = lower strike (more aggressive)
  - Puts: Bullish technicals = safer (stock moving away); Calls: Bearish technicals = safer
  - Puts: Gap-down earnings risk more severe (assignment at bad entry); Calls: Gap-up risk loses profit potential
  - Puts: Earnings gate MORE critical due to downside asymmetry

## Learnings

### Gate Design Philosophy (from Roll Strategy Work)
- **Super-majority gates (3 mandatory + 4 of 7 flexible) provide optimal balance:**
  - Mandatory floor ensures non-negotiable safety requirements (OTM margin, delta, DTE)
  - Flexible majority allows for real-world market conditions (not everything perfect simultaneously)
  - 4 of 7 = 57% agreement threshold still requires substantial confirmation
- **Unanimous gates (9/9) are overly restrictive in practice:**
  - Market conditions rarely align perfectly on all factors simultaneously
  - Misses valid optimization opportunities where risk is acceptably low
  - Single outlier can block an otherwise safe trade
- **Research-backed thresholds are critical:**
  - Delta <0.20 = <20% assignment probability (quantifiable risk)
  - OTM margin 3.5% exceeds typical noise range 2-3% (empirical)
  - DTE 15+ provides meaningful theta decay window (time-value math)
  - Citing research (TastyTrade, Option Alpha, CBOE) builds trust and justifies relaxations

### Strategy-Specific Risk Asymmetries
- **Puts vs Calls have opposite directional implications:**
  - **Puts:** Rolling UP = higher strike = more aggressive (closer to money, higher assignment risk)
  - **Calls:** Rolling DOWN = lower strike = more aggressive (closer to money, higher assignment risk)
  - Must adapt language and risk framing accordingly in chat instructions
- **Earnings risk severity differs:**
  - **Puts:** Gap-down on earnings miss can move safe OTM position to deep ITM instantly (catastrophic assignment at bad entry)
  - **Calls:** Gap-up on earnings beat moves OTM to ITM (assignment loses upside, but stock still profitable)
  - Puts require stricter earnings gate adherence due to downside asymmetry
- **Technical indicator interpretation flips:**
  - **Puts:** Bullish technicals = safer (stock moving away from strike, reducing assignment risk)
  - **Calls:** Bearish technicals = safer (stock moving away from strike, reducing assignment risk)
  - Gate conditions must account for this directional inversion

### Code Instruction Design Patterns
- **Dual instruction pattern works well:**
  1. **Formal instructions** (`tv_open_put_instructions.py`): Detailed gate logic, research citations, precise thresholds
  2. **Chat instructions** (`tv_open_put_chat_instructions.py`): Conversational guidance, example language, plain-English explanations
  - Formal instructions for programmatic analysis (structured JSON output)
  - Chat instructions for quick user-facing analysis (natural language)
  - Keep both in sync but adapt tone/style to audience
- **Example-driven guidance is powerful:**
  - Providing "Good setup", "Marginal setup", "Blocker" scenario examples helps model understand application
  - Realistic conversational phrasing ("Here's what I'm seeing...", "The interesting thing is...") sets tone
  - "When NOT to suggest" lists prevent over-optimization and maintain safety standards
- **Critical overrides must be explicit and repeated:**
  - Earnings gate override mentioned in multiple places (mandatory conditions, critical override section, examples)
  - "NON-NEGOTIABLE" language emphasizes absolute nature
  - Prevents model from trading off earnings risk against other favorable conditions

### Consistency and Cross-Strategy Alignment
- **When relaxing multiple strategies, maintain parallel structure:**
  - Same gate logic (3 mandatory + 4 of 7 flexible) across call roll down and put roll up
  - Same threshold adjustments (delta, OTM, DTE) for consistency
  - Same research basis and safety preservation principles
  - Easier to understand, debug, and maintain when structures mirror each other
- **Adapt for strategy-specific risks while preserving framework:**
  - Framework (super-majority gate) stays consistent
  - Individual conditions flip based on directional risk (bullish/bearish for puts vs calls)
  - Emphasis changes (earnings MORE critical for puts) without changing gate structure
  - Allows team to reason about all strategies using same mental model

### Decision Documentation Best Practices
- **Analysis-first, implementation-second workflow:**
  - Created detailed analysis document (`put_strategy_analysis.md`) with research, comparisons, recommendations
  - User reviewed and approved before implementation
  - Implementation then follows approved spec exactly
  - Reduces rework and ensures alignment before code changes
- **Decision records should capture context and rationale:**
  - Not just "what changed" but "why we changed it"
  - Research citations and threshold justifications
  - Comparison to alternatives (unanimous vs super-majority)
  - Safety preservation mechanisms documented
  - Future maintainers can understand decision basis, not just current state

## Scheduler Config Auto-Reload Implementation (2025-01)

### Problem Solved
Web UI and scheduler ran as separate processes. When users changed cron schedules via web UI (saved to CosmosDB), the scheduler never picked up the changes because the `_cron_changed` flags were in a different process memory space.

### Solution: Periodic Config Reload
Implemented automatic config reloading in `src/main.py`:
- Every 60 seconds, scheduler queries CosmosDB via `cosmos.get_settings()`
- Compares loaded values with in-memory state
- Detects changes to:
  - Main monitoring cron (`scheduler.cron`)
  - Summary agent cron (`summary_agent.cron`)
  - Timezone (`scheduler.timezone`)
- When changes detected, sets internal flags (`_cron_changed`, `_summary_cron_changed`)
- Existing reschedule logic handles the actual job updates
- Prints clear notifications: "✓ Config reloaded from CosmosDB: summary cron changed to X"

### Implementation Details
- Added `_last_config_reload` timestamp and `_config_reload_interval = 60` to `__init__`
- Created `_reload_config_from_cosmos()` method with change detection logic
- Added periodic reload check in main `run()` loop
- Error handling prevents config reload failures from crashing scheduler
- Backward compatible: `reschedule()` and `reschedule_summary()` still work for future use

### Key Design Decisions
- **60-second interval:** Balances responsiveness vs CosmosDB query cost
- **Reuses existing reschedule logic:** Sets flags that existing code already handles
- **Non-blocking:** Config reload errors logged but don't stop scheduler
- **Updates all relevant settings:** Also syncs `summary_agent.enabled` and `activity_count`

### Testing Approach
Mental test: User changes cron in web UI → CosmosDB updated → within 60s, scheduler detects change → reschedules jobs → user sees new schedule applied without restart.

## Symbol Chat Context Selection Screen UX (2025-01)

### Problem Solved
Previous chat flow immediately loaded chat interface with context checkboxes at the top. Users couldn't make deliberate context choices before starting - they had to toggle checkboxes while chatting, which was confusing and didn't clearly show what context was loaded.

### Solution: Two-Screen Flow
Implemented a selection-first UX pattern in `web/templates/symbol_chat.html`:
1. **Selection Screen:** Users see 3 context checkboxes with descriptions + "Start Chat" button
2. **Chat Screen:** Shows locked-in context and chat interface (with optional "Change Context" button)

### Implementation Details
**HTML Structure:**
- `#selectionScreen` div: Contains checkboxes in card-style boxes with descriptions, centered layout
- `#chatScreen` div: Contains context indicator + chat interface (initially `display: none`)
- Each checkbox option now has title + description for clarity
- "Start Chat" button triggers transition

**JavaScript Flow:**
- On page load: Selection screen visible, checkboxes populated from localStorage
- On "Start Chat" click:
  - Save preferences to localStorage
  - Hide selection screen, show chat screen
  - Update context indicator (shows selected sources in compact format)
  - Call `loadContext()` with locked preferences
  - Set `chatStarted` flag
- On "Change Context" click:
  - Reset chat state (history, cachedContext, messages)
  - Show selection screen, hide chat screen
  - Allows starting fresh session with different context

**Key Features:**
- Context preferences persist via localStorage (same key as before)
- Context indicator shows active sources: "📊 TV • 📈 Positions • 📋 Activities"
- Clean, centered card design for selection screen with descriptive text
- "Change Context" button allows resetting without page reload
- Button states managed (disabled during loading, text changes)

### Design Decisions
- **Selection-first over inline toggles:** Makes context choices deliberate and visible
- **Locked context after start:** Prevents mid-chat confusion about what data is loaded
- **Reset on context change:** Clearer than trying to merge new context into existing chat
- **Descriptions on each checkbox:** "Real-time price, volume, and technical indicators" helps users understand what they're selecting
- **localStorage persistence:** Remembers user preferences across sessions

### UX Benefits
- Users consciously choose context before engaging
- Clear visibility of what data the assistant has access to
- Reduced confusion about checkbox toggles during chat
- Clean, focused selection interface before chat starts

### Dashboard Alert Count Timeframes (2026-04-01)
- Updated dashboard alert counts from calendar-based to rolling window timeframes
- **Backend (`web/app.py`)**: Modified `_count_by_range()` function to use rolling windows:
  - "This Week" → Last 7 days: `now - timedelta(days=7)`
  - "This Month" → Last 30 days: `now - timedelta(days=30)`
  - "Today" remains as midnight UTC to now
- **Frontend (`web/templates/dashboard.html`)**: Updated labels in summary cards and agent table headers:
  - "This Week" → "Last 7 Days"
  - "This Month" → "Last 30 Days"
- The dictionary keys remain `"week"` and `"month"` internally for backward compatibility
- All counts now use rolling windows instead of calendar-aligned periods (no Monday reset for week, no month-start reset)

### Dashboard Alert Timeframe Migration (2026-04-02)
- Orchestrated update from calendar-based to rolling window alert timeframes
- **Backend (`web/app.py`)**: Modified `_count_by_range()` to use rolling windows
  - "This Week" → Last 7 days (rolling window)
  - "This Month" → Last 30 days (rolling window)
  - Consistent date ranges regardless of calendar alignment
- **Frontend (`web/templates/dashboard.html`)**: Updated UI labels for clarity
  - Removed calendar-based terminology
  - Added rolling window descriptions
- Benefits: Predictable, consistent date ranges for alert monitoring; no confusion from week/month resets

### Context Selection Screen Styling Update (2026-04-02)
- **Task**: Applied settings page styling to the "Select Context Sources" screen in `web/templates/symbol_chat.html`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `.settings-card` class to match settings containers
  - Added `.card-header` with `<h2>` title (Settings pattern)
  - Converted description paragraph to `.hint` class
  - Wrapped content in `style="padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem;"` container (standard padding pattern from settings)
  - Maintained checkbox labels and button functionality
- **Visual Consistency**: Context selection screen now matches look and feel of Settings/Configuration page
  - Same card styling and borders
  - Same header treatment
  - Same padding and spacing patterns
  - Same hint text styling for descriptions
- **Files Modified**: `web/templates/symbol_chat.html` (lines 11-48)
- **Pattern**: Settings page uses `.card.settings-card` + `.card-header` + `.hint` + consistent padding wrapper for all configuration containers

### Context Selection Screen Styling Orchestration (2026-04-02T09:24:24Z)
- **Requested By**: dsanchor
- **Mode**: Background agent execution
- **Task Assigned**: Match context selection screen styling to settings/configuration page
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - web/templates/symbol_chat.html updated with .settings-card class
  - .card-header structure applied for header consistency
  - Padding standardized to match settings page (0.75rem 1.25rem)
- **Orchestration Log**: .squad/orchestration-log/2026-04-02T09:24:24Z-linus.md
- **Session Log**: .squad/log/2026-04-02T09:24:24Z-context-styling.md

### Symbol Chat: Removed Change Context Button (2026-04-02)
- **Task**: Removed "Change Context" button from symbol chat interface
- **Rationale**: User prefers to manually navigate back to context selection screen rather than having an in-chat button
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `⚙️ Change Context` button from chat header (was on lines 55-57)
  - Removed `changeContextBtn` variable declaration from JavaScript (line 90)
  - Removed entire `changeContextBtn.addEventListener('click')` event handler (lines 270-298)
  - Updated flex container to use `justify-content: flex-end` instead of `space-between` (context indicator now right-aligned)
- **Files Modified**: `web/templates/symbol_chat.html`
- **User Pattern**: Prefers explicit navigation over in-context actions for changing chat settings

## Learnings

### Alert Generation Logic Fixed (2026-04-02)
- **Issue**: Alert generation was using narrow whitelist approach - only marking specific activities (SELL, ROLL_*) as alerts
- **Root Cause**: `_is_sell_alert()` and `_is_roll_alert()` methods only checked for specific activity types
- **User Requirement**: "Anything that is NOT wait, hold, or doing nothing should be marked as alert"
- **Solution**: 
  - Created unified `_is_alert()` method that uses blacklist approach
  - Defined `_NON_ALERT_ACTIVITIES` frozenset: {"WAIT", "HOLD", "DO_NOTHING", "DOING_NOTHING"}
  - Logic: `activity not in _NON_ALERT_ACTIVITIES` = alert
  - Replaced both `_is_sell_alert()` and `_is_roll_alert()` with single `_is_alert()` method
  - Both covered_call and position monitor agents now use same alert detection logic
- **Files Modified**: `src/agent_runner.py`
- **Key Principle**: Use negative logic (what's NOT an alert) rather than positive logic (what IS an alert) when the exception list is smaller than the inclusion list
- **Architecture**: Alert field (`is_alert`) is set on all activities; alerts are just activities with `is_alert=true`

### Alert Logic Unified: Blacklist Approach (2026-04-03)
Changed alert detection from whitelist (checking specific activities like SELL, ROLL_*) to blacklist (marking everything except WAIT, HOLD, DO_NOTHING as alerts). This matches the user requirement: "Anything that is NOT wait, hold or doing nothing should be marked as alert." Implemented via unified `_is_alert()` method checking `activity NOT IN _NON_ALERT_ACTIVITIES`, making new activity types automatically alerts (safer, future-proof). Files: src/tv_open_call_agent.py, src/tv_open_put_agent.py.

### CosmosDB Alert Flag Fix Script (2026-04-03)
- **Task**: Built script to fix existing activities in CosmosDB that have incorrect `is_alert` values from old logic
- **Script Location**: `scripts/fix_alert_flags.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - Cross-partition query to fetch all activities (`doc_type='activity'`)
  - Recalculates `is_alert` using blacklist approach: `activity.upper() NOT IN ["WAIT", "HOLD", "DO_NOTHING", "DOING_NOTHING"]`
  - Dry-run mode (`--dry-run`) to preview changes without updating
  - Detailed statistics: total activities, correct/incorrect counts, breakdown by action type
  - Progress tracking during updates with error handling
  - Sample output display in dry-run mode
- **Technical Details**:
  - Uses `container.query_items()` with `enable_cross_partition_query=True`
  - Updates via `container.replace_item()` to preserve all other fields
  - Loads config from `config.yaml` with environment variable expansion
  - Comprehensive error handling with per-item error logging
- **Documentation**: `scripts/README_fix_alert_flags.md` with usage examples and output samples
- **Pattern**: Always provide dry-run mode for data migration scripts to allow safe preview before applying changes
- **User Workflow**: Run with `--dry-run` first, review stats, then run without flag to apply fixes

### CosmosDB Alert Flags Fix Script (2026-04-03)
- Delivered `scripts/fix_alert_flags.py` with dry-run mode, progress tracking, and comprehensive statistics
- Recalculates `is_alert` flags for existing activities using new blacklist approach
- Features: cursor-based pagination for large datasets, atomic per-item updates, detailed error reporting, stats summary
- Documented with `scripts/README_fix_alert_flags.md` including usage examples and sample outputs
- Follows best practices: dry-run preview before applying changes, per-item error isolation, config loading with env expansion

### SKIPPED Added to Non-Alert Blacklist (2026-04-03)
- **Task**: Add "SKIPPED" to non-alert activities blacklist so it's not marked as an alert
- **User Pattern**: "skipped should not be marked as alert" - user wants SKIPPED treated same as WAIT/HOLD/DO_NOTHING
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `src/agent_runner.py`: Added "SKIPPED" to `_NON_ALERT_ACTIVITIES` frozenset
  - Updated `scripts/fix_alert_flags.py`: Added "SKIPPED" to `NON_ALERT_ACTIVITIES` frozenset
  - Updated `scripts/README_fix_alert_flags.md`: Documentation now lists SKIPPED in blacklist
  - Updated docstring in `_is_alert()` method to mention "skipped" in the rule description
- **New Blacklist**: `["WAIT", "HOLD", "DO_NOTHING", "DOING_NOTHING", "SKIPPED"]`
- **Behavior**: Any activity with action="SKIPPED" will now have `is_alert=false`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/agent_runner.py`
  - `scripts/fix_alert_flags.py`
  - `scripts/README_fix_alert_flags.md`
- **Note**: Users can run `python scripts/fix_alert_flags.py` to update any existing SKIPPED activities in CosmosDB

### TradingView 403 Resilience Analysis (2025-01-24)
- **Issue**: Persistent 403 errors from TradingView blacklisting session after accessing "hot" symbols
- **Root Cause Identified**:
  - Single persistent `requests.Session()` used throughout fetcher lifetime (line 749)
  - Global `has_403` flag poisons ALL subsequent symbols, even unrelated ones (lines 805, 821, 1252)
  - No per-symbol isolation — one bad symbol kills entire batch
  - TradingView fingerprints: session cookies, IP+UA combo, request velocity, missing natural navigation
- **Current Agent Pattern**: All agents iterate symbols sequentially with shared fetcher (covered_call_agent.py:44-50)
- **Proposed Solution** (4-phase implementation):
  1. **Per-symbol 403 tracking**: Replace global `has_403` with `_banned_symbols: set[str]` + `_symbol_403_count: dict`
  2. **Session rotation**: Create fresh session after N requests (configurable, default 8) + warmup flow (homepage → SPY → target)
  3. **Graduated cooldown**: First 403 → 30s + session reset, second → 2min, third → blacklist symbol
  4. **Symbol randomization**: Shuffle symbol list in agents to avoid predictable patterns
- **Key Architectural Changes**:
  - Lazy session creation with `_ensure_session()` method
  - Warmup sequence (`_warmup_session()`) to mimic human browsing (homepage, then SPY, then target)
  - Per-symbol ban check (`_is_symbol_banned()`) before fetch
  - Session-level request counter to trigger rotation
  - Enhanced rate limiting config: 2-4s for regular, 5-10s for options chain
- **Config Additions**: `tradingview.max_requests_per_session`, `warmup_enabled`, `symbol_cooldown_after_403`, `max_403_per_symbol`, `symbol_ban_duration`
- **Expected Outcomes**: Resilience (one bad symbol won't poison batch), lower 403 rate (session rotation looks human), graceful degradation (per-symbol failures), improved stealth
- **Files Analyzed**: `src/tv_data_fetcher.py` (lines 730-1324), agent files (covered_call_agent.py, cash_secured_put_agent.py, monitor agents), config.yaml
- **Decision Document**: `.squad/decisions/inbox/linus-anti403-implementation.md` — comprehensive proposal with pseudocode
- **Key Pattern**: Session isolation is critical for scraper resilience — never let one resource failure poison unrelated resources

### Summary Agent Multi-Agent-Type Bug Fix (2026-MM-DD)

**Problem**: `CosmosDBClient.get_recent_activities_by_symbol()` fetched only N most recent activities **overall** per symbol, not N per agent_type. This caused symbols with both put and call watching to have incomplete summary data — only the most active agent_type would be represented, while the other would be omitted entirely.

**Root Cause**: Original implementation in `src/cosmos_db.py:667` used `TOP @limit` on a single query filtering only by `doc_type = 'activity'`, without considering `agent_type`. If a symbol had 10 recent `covered_call` activities and 2 recent `cash_secured_put` activities, only the `covered_call` activities would be returned when `limit_per_symbol=3`.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Changed `get_recent_activities_by_symbol()` to iterate over all four agent_types (`covered_call`, `cash_secured_put`, `open_call_monitor`, `open_put_monitor`) and query each separately with `TOP @limit` per agent_type
- Merged results from all agent_types and sorted by timestamp DESC (newest first) before returning
- Updated docstring to clarify: fetches `limit_per_symbol` activities **per agent_type**, so total activities per symbol may be up to `limit_per_symbol × 4`
- Maintained return type `dict[str, list[dict]]` for backward compatibility with existing callers

**Impact**:
- Summary agent (`run_summary_agent` in `agent_runner.py:683`) now receives complete activity history for all active agent types
- Ensures symbols with both put and call watching (or both watch + monitor agents) have all agent types represented in daily summaries
- No breaking changes — callers just receive more complete data

**Files Modified**:
- `src/cosmos_db.py` — `get_recent_activities_by_symbol()` method (lines 667-700)

**Key Learning**: When aggregating multi-dimensional data (symbol × agent_type), ensure per-dimension limits to avoid skewing toward the most active dimension. Cross-partition queries with `TOP` need careful filtering to guarantee representation across all dimensions.

## 2025-01-27 — Premium-First Roll Policy Implementation

**What**: Added mandatory Premium-First Roll Policy section to both monitor instruction files (`tv_open_call_instructions.py` and `tv_open_put_instructions.py`). Enforces economic discipline on all roll recommendations by requiring agents to calculate roll economics before recommending any roll.

**Why**: Previous instructions allowed agents to recommend rolls without calculating actual costs. This created risk of expensive defensive rolls that erode capital without systematic evaluation of alternatives. The new policy forces income-first thinking while allowing defensive rolls up to a $20 debit cap.

**Policy Structure**:
- **Tier 1 (Preferred)**: Net credit ≥$1.00 — roll generates income, approved automatically
- **Tier 2 (Acceptable)**: Net debit ≤$20.00 — acceptable insurance cost to avoid assignment, requires `ultra_defensive_roll` risk flag
- **Tier 3 (Rejected)**: Net debit >$20.00 — do NOT recommend, execute Roll Search Algorithm or CLOSE

**Roll Search Algorithm**: When initial roll candidate fails, systematically search:
1. Same strike, +1 week expiration
2. ±1 strike increment (calls roll UP, puts roll DOWN), same expiration
3. Combined: ±1 strike AND +1 week
4. If all fail → CLOSE

**New JSON Schema Fields**:
```json
"roll_economics": {
  "buyback_cost": 2.50,      // ASK price of current option
  "new_premium": 3.80,       // BID price of roll target
  "net_credit": 1.30,        // new_premium - buyback_cost
  "roll_tier": "credit",     // or "ultra_defensive" or "no_viable_roll"
  "candidates_evaluated": 4  // how many roll candidates analyzed
}
```
Set to `null` for WAIT, populated for all ROLL and CLOSE activities.

**New Risk Flags**:
- `ultra_defensive_roll`: Roll with net debit ≤$20, acceptable insurance cost
- `no_viable_roll`: No roll candidate meets premium-first policy thresholds

**Updated CLOSE Logic**: Now only recommended when (1) fundamental thesis changed, OR (2) no viable roll exists after executing Roll Search Algorithm. When CLOSE due to #2, set `roll_tier = "no_viable_roll"`.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/tv_open_call_instructions.py` — Added Premium-First Roll Policy section after Roll Candidate Selection (line ~325), updated CLOSE description, added roll_economics to JSON schema, added new risk flags, updated all ROLL examples to show math
- `src/tv_open_put_instructions.py` — Same changes, put-specific (rolls DOWN for defensive moves)

**Key Learning**: Agent instruction quality benefits from explicit economic calculations rather than subjective "cost-effective" judgments. Three-tier hierarchy (preferred/acceptable/rejected) provides clear decision boundaries while maintaining flexibility for defensive scenarios. Roll Search Algorithm prevents agents from giving up after first failed candidate — forces systematic evaluation of strike/expiration combinations. Options chain data is already available in Section 4, so calculations are straightforward: buyback cost = ask price of current, new premium = bid price of target.

**Impact**:
- Monitor agents now calculate and report exact roll economics for every ROLL and CLOSE recommendation
- Transparent math in reason field allows user verification
- Systematic search reduces missed opportunities for better roll candidates
- $1 credit threshold aligns with income-first philosophy of covered call/put strategy
- $20 debit cap prevents runaway losses while allowing reasonable defensive rolls

**Research Basis**: 
- Net credit threshold aligns with income generation goal of covered options strategy
- $20 debit cap based on ~3% of typical $70-$200 strike positions — reasonable insurance cost relative to assignment consequences (forced stock sale at unfavorable price)
- Roll Search Algorithm derived from common practitioner workflows: time extension first (cheapest), then strike adjustment, then combined

**Future Considerations**: May need to adjust $1 and $20 thresholds based on real-world agent performance. Could add Tier 2.5 for larger accounts or adjust thresholds dynamically based on position size. Profit Optimization sections remain separate logic for OTM positions. Mandatory Earnings Gate remains independent and takes priority over roll economics.
